        Keep Scrolling | Thank you for taking your precious time in taking part
        in the event. What is your stupid idea? Come have fun with us! Are you
        still reading this? God please don't tell me you are still reading this.
        AHHH I did not think people will still keep reading this. Since you are
        still reading this, I must confess, they are coming for you. I do not
        know what is going to happen. The reptile poeple are all around us. They
        are taking over and controlling us. They have escaped, we might be in
        danger. WE need to keep our minds protected. The Illuminati is coming
        for us. Ever wondered why the water is tasting slightly crunchier these
        days? It is mind control juice. Now you know why that drink is called
        Liquid death and all these teenagers are drinking it? We are all going
        to be one. The higher power is about to save us all. Make sure you wake
        up in the morning, on the right side of the bed, hop thrice, and drink a
        cup of luke warm water with three and a half drops of olive oil. They
        wont be able to get to us. They have escaped their nest. Becuase they
        don't belive in love and brotherhood. They want to merge our minds.
        BEWARE. That is all I had to say. If you are still reading it, its
        getting a little out of hand, I am pretty sure at this point you are
        just procrastinating. Please go get your work done.
