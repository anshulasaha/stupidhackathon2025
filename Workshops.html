          Build Artificially Unintelligent Websites with React + LLMs – Lachlan
          Campbell
        </h3>

        <p>
          React is the JavaScript library used by the largest companies to build
          their most important websites. We’re going to use the same tools to
          make tiny, stupid websites, made stupider with generative AI. We’ll
          cover the basics of setting up a website with Vite and React.js
          components, using React Hooks to add interactivity to the site, then
          using Replicate’s open source AI models to add the worst text/image
          generation you’ve ever seen. Come with basic JavaScript experience,
          leave with a website!
