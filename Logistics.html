        <p>
          Please come on time at 10am tomorrow! Come to <a
            href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/fu2EGszyh772f7YE6"
            >370 Jay St</a
          >—it&#8217;s above the Jay St-MetroTech subway station. There will be
          a sign-in table in the entryway that will point you to the 4th floor.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <mark>If you are an NYU student</mark>, you can enter and exit the
            building anytime. You will be given a name tag at the check-in
            desk—wear it for the entire hackathon so we can identify you.
          </li>
          <li>
            <mark>If you are not an NYU student</mark>, you must bring a
            government ID and must have already RSVP’d on Eventbrite (or emailed
            us already).
          </li>
          <li>
            Anyone who didn’t already RSVP and is not an NYU student will not be
            allowed to enter. We&#8217;re unfortunately at capacity.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          If you arrive after 1:00 PM and are not a current NYU student, you’ll
          need to contact us (<a href="mailto:as15388@nyu.edu">Anshula</a> and
          <a href="mailto:lachlanjc@nyu.edu">Lachlan</a>), and we might be able
          to check you in. But after 1:00 PM we cannot guarantee entry.
        </p>

        <h2>Groups, Workshops, &amp; Food</h2>

        <p>
          You can work alone or in a group. We&#8217;ll have a grouping game at
          the beginning to meet collaborators; only  <mark
            >current ITP/IMA students can access shop tools</mark
          >  (laser cutters, 3D printers, etc). You&#8217;re welcome to bring
          your own tools.
        </p>

        <p>
          We have a bunch of workshops lined up, covering games, 3D
          modeling/printing, AI, and physical computing—<a
            href="https://itpstupidhackathon.online/Workshops.html"
            >here’s the schedule</a
          >.
        </p>

        <p>
          Food: We are providing lunch and snacks throughout the day, but <mark
            >NOT dinner.</mark
          >
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Bring your own dinner or plan to grab something during the dinner
            break, there&#8217;s tons of fast casual/restaurants nearby
          </li>
          <li>
            If you leave the building for dinner, check-in will be open again
            from 6:00 PM–7:30 PM, so <mark>keep your name tag</mark> for
            re-entry.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What to bring</h2>
